# CS-255-System-Analysis-and-Design

This project involved developing a comprehensive system for DriverPass, a client specializing in driver training. The primary goal was to create a platform that provides driving students with seamless access to online classes, practice tests, and scheduling for on-the-road training. The system was designed with a dual-purpose approach, integrating a learning management system (LMS) for online learning and a robust scheduling feature. This feature allows students to book training appointments online, while also giving the DriverPass secretary the ability to schedule for clients in person or over the phone.

The system was built to handle multiple user types with varying levels of access. The Owner has complete administrative control over all accounts, and the IT Officer can maintain and update the system. To ensure the content remains current, the system is designed to automatically receive updates on new regulations, course content, and practice questions from local DMVs.

In this project, my strongest contribution was the Business Requirements Document. It provided a detailed and thorough outline of the system’s purpose, background, and both its functional and non-functional requirements.

A key aspect of this project was the emphasis on understanding and addressing the client's needs. Through direct engagement and careful listening during the initial interview with DriverPass, I was able to translate their desired functionalities into a well-structured system design. This experience reinforced a critical principle: a system's success is directly tied to its ability to satisfy the user’s needs.

Developing this system underscored the importance of establishing a strong foundation through detailed requirements gathering. An in-depth understanding of what a system must do provides a clear roadmap and end goal, which in turn makes the subsequent design and development phases more efficient and effective. This process taught me that investing time in thorough requirements collection is essential for a successful project outcome.
